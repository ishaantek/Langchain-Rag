What is the sign-up process?

Upon receipt of your images, a GRUBBRR specialist will upload your menu and create a custom User Interface (UI) in about 4-5 business days. Thereafter, you will receive a proof of your menu to review and approve. Once GRUBBRR receives your final menu approval, a GRUBBRR specialist will provide you with the final product within 2 business days. Don’t worry, if you need to make changes to your menu in the future, GRUBBRR will provide you with training on how to make changes through the GRUBBRR system’s backend.

Where should I display the GRUBBRR Kiosk?
